youtube_darker is a cross-platform application built using the [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev), to offer a fast user experience, a re-defined approach towards social media and fun across various platforms. youtube_darker works currently supports Android and IOS, with a possible port to the Web. 

It would be possible to target both Windows and MacOs ( even linus ), but with Web apps becoming much more popular and diverse ; It has long been decided that a function Web Application would kill 3 birds with one stone.

### Core Development Environment

  

We want to enable designers to deliver their full creative vision without being
forced to water it down due to limitations of the underlying framework.

  

### A Dockerized Environment

  

Flutter is fast. It's powered by the same hardware-accelerated 2D graphics
library that underpins Chrome and Android.

  

### Use of the Open-source model concept

  

The open-source model is a decentralized software development model that encourages open collaboration.

  
### Future Plans
- [x] Code formatting.
- [ ] Introduce the ML Kit and other Tensorflow model.
- [ ] Many more internal features.
